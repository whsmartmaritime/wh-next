  Precise dynamic control: Distinguishing between **speed through water** and
  **speed over ground** to optimize maneuvering and fuel efficiency.

## 1. Introduction: The Importance of Velocity in Safety and Efficiency

The **Speed Log** is a fundamental maritime instrument, providing necessary velocity information for most maneuvering and calculation activities. Accurate speed data is the foundation for calculating **Dead Reckoning**, supports ARPA in target tracking, and controls compliance with speed regulations. This article focuses on the difference between **STW** and **SOG**, specialized measurement technologies (**Electromagnetic Log** and **Doppler Log**), and their role in energy management and maritime safety.

## 2. Distinguishing Speed Types and Tactical Applications

Speed logs provide two types of velocity with different physical origins.

### 2.1. STW (Speed Through Water)

- **Definition:** The ship's velocity relative to the surrounding mass of water.
- **Application:** It is the primary indicator for assessing the ship's **Hydrodynamic Performance**, controlling propeller revolutions (RPM) to optimize fuel consumption.

### 2.2. SOG (Speed Over Ground)

- **Definition:** The ship's velocity relative to the seabed (or ground).
- **Application:** This is the ship's actual speed relative to targets and terrain, paramount for **Dead Reckoning** and safe maneuvering. The difference between SOG and STW is primarily due to the influence of **Current**.

## 3. Specialized Speed Measurement Technologies

SOLAS vessels are typically required to be equipped with at least one STW measuring device and one independent SOG measuring device.

### 3.1. Electromagnetic Log (EM Log)

- **Principle:** Based on **Faraday's Law of Electromagnetic Induction**. A coil under the hull generates a magnetic field. When water (a conductor) moves across this field, a voltage is induced in the sensor, proportional to the STW.
- **Advantages:** High accuracy, no moving parts (low maintenance), direct STW measurement.

### 3.2. Doppler Velocity Log (DVL)

- **Principle:** DVL transmits high-frequency acoustic beams towards the seabed. When the beams reflect back, their frequency changes (**Doppler Effect**). This frequency shift is proportional to the relative velocity of the ship to the seabed.

  **Doppler Formula:** Δf = 2 × f_t × (v cos θ)/c

- **Three-Axis Measurement:** Professional DVLs use at least **three to four beams** to measure velocity along three axes: **Longitudinal**, **Transverse** (Drift), and **Vertical** (Heave).
- **Water Track Mode:** In excessively deep water (typically over 200m), the DVL switches to measuring velocity relative to a deep water layer (STW), limiting accurate SOG measurement to certain depth limits.

## 4. Integrated Applications and Performance Management

Data from the Speed Log is a crucial input for complex systems onboard.

### 4.1. Maneuvering and DP Support

- **Transverse Speed:** Data from DVL is essential for controlling the vessel during berthing or channel navigation, where transverse drift can be hazardous.
- **Dynamic Positioning (DP):** In DP systems, DVL is one of the primary sensors, providing accurate SOG to counteract wind and current forces.

### 4.2. Fuel Efficiency Optimization

- **Current Compensation:** Comparing STW with SOG helps officers accurately calculate the **Current Set and Drift** impact, allowing for steering adjustments to optimize the desired SOG with minimum fuel consumption.

## 5. International Standards and Calibration Requirements

Speed logs must strictly comply with **IMO Performance Standards** (Resolution A.824(19)).

- **Mandatory Accuracy:** The accuracy of the Speed Log needs to be checked and calibrated periodically.
- **System Errors:** Errors commonly occur due to misalignment or **fouling** (which disrupts water flow across the Transducer).

Wheelhouse provides advanced Speed Log solutions from manufacturers like **Furuno**, **JRC**, and **Koden**, ensuring compliance with IMO standards and optimizing the ship's maneuvering performance.
